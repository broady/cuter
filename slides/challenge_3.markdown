### Challenge 3: Drawing shapes

Extend your code from [Challenge 1](javascript:setSlide(13)) to draw a {Polygon} by connecting each {Marker} added to the map.

If a {Marker} that is already on the map is clicked, then the {Polygon} should be filled in.

<button class="btn" onclick="javascript:if(confirm('Are you sure you want to get code from Challenge 1?')) editor.getSession().setValue(localStorage.getItem('13'))">Get
code from Challenge 1</button>

### Code
// Good luck!
