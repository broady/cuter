### Challenge 1: Make your mark.

The first challenge is to write a program which places a marker on the map each time the map is clicked, at the location which was clicked.

**Hint:** You might need to make _map_ a global object. Do this by declaring it outside the initialize() function.

    var map;
    function initialize() {
       ...
    }

### Code
// Good luck!
