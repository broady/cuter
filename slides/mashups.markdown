### Mashups

Because Javascript is a dynamic language, and because you can load Javascript from any website, it is the perfect language for writing libraries. Developers don't need to deal with linker errors or DLLs, and libraries can be automatically updated when a page is refreshed.

The Maps API is only one of hundreds of Javascript libraries like [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and Raphael JS. There are also HTTP APIs like the [Flickr API](http://www.flickr.com/services/api) or [Google+ APIs](http://developers.google.com/+/api/). These expose interesting data via HTTP requests, which you can make with Javascript.
