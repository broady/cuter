### Introduction

This lab walks you through some different components of the Maps API and Javascript.

Most websites are built from a combination of HTML (appearance) and Javascript (behaviour). We want to focus on programming, so each excercise contains pre-built HTML.

Click **Run** to execute the code in the editor.

Click **Show Elements** to view the IDs of each HTML element in the output page.
